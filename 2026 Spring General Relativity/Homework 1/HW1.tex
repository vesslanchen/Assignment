\question{1}{}
\begin{itemize}
    \item [(a)]Consider the outer surface of the ergosphere for a Kerr black hole. Construct the normal vector to this surface and show that it is a $2$-way surface.
    \item [(b)]Using the condition $n_\alpha n^\alpha = 0$ for a null surface, derive the equation equation for the critical $1$-way surface for a time-independent axial symmetric surface. That is start with some $u(\rho, \theta)$ to derive the equation defining this surface. What is its physical interpretation.
\end{itemize}

\question{2}{}
Show that 
\begin{align}
    (L_X T)^{a_1 a_2 \dots a_r}_{b_1 b_2 \dots b_s} = (\nabla_X T)^{a_1 a_2 \dots a_r}_{b_1 b_2 \dots b_s}-\sum_i T^{a_1 \dots j \dots a_r}_{b_1 b_2 \dots b_s} X^{a_i}_{;j} + \sum_j T^{a_1 a_2 \dots a_r}_{b_1 \dots j \dots b_s} X^j_{;b_j}
\end{align}

\question{3}{}
\begin{itemize}
    \item [(a)] Consider an arbitrary unit vector, $X$ transported along a latitude line on the surface of the sphere. Use $ds^2 =  d\theta^2 +  \sin^2 \theta d\phi^2$, and ecall that there are only 2 distinct $\Gamma$’s.
    \item[(b)] Do the same assuming the vector is Lie transported. That is instead of $\nabla_T X =0$, assume that $L_T X =0$.
\end{itemize}
