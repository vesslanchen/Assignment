\question{1}{}
The metric for the surface of a sphere of radius $a$ is given by 
\begin{align}
    g_{\theta\theta} = a^2, \quad g_{\phi\phi} = a^2\sin^2\theta, \quad g_{\theta\phi} = g_{\phi\theta} = 0.
\end{align}
Calculate the Gaussian curvature $K=-\frac{1}{2}R$ for this space. Then calculate the Gaussian curvature for a space with a metric given by 
\begin{align}
    g_{xx}=\frac{a^2 (1-y^2)}{(1-x^2 - y^2)^2}, \quad g_{yy}=\frac{a^2 (1-x^2)}{(1-x^2 - y^2)^2}, \quad g_{xy}=g_{yx}=\frac{a^2 xy}{(1-x^2 - y^2)^2},
\end{align}
where $x^2 + y^2 < 1$. Notice that the distance between two points is unbounded because of the denominators. Can you imagine such a space?

\question{2}{}
In class we were to led to Einstein's field equation with the inclusion of a cosmological constant. 
\begin{align}
    R_{\mu\nu} - \frac{1}{2}g_{\mu\nu}R + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu} = -8\pi G T_{\mu\nu}.
\end{align}
Find the nonrelativistic, static, weak field limit of this equation. The constant $\Lambda$ has dimension of $1/$length$^2$. Calculate the numerical value of $\Lambda$ based on the numerical value of the dark energy inferred from cosmological observations.
