\question{1}{}
Calculate the metric $g_{ij}$ and its inverse $g^{ij}$ , the affine connection $\Gamma^{i}_{jk}$, and the Laplacian $\nabla^2$ in two dimensions for a polar coordinate system with $\xi^1 = x$ and $\xi^2 = y$ being Cartesian coordinates and $x^1 = r$ and $x^2 = \theta$ being polar coordinates.
\answer{}

\question{2}{}
Calculate the compact expressions for the components of the affine connection when the metric $g_{ij}$ is diagonal. See problem 3 in chapter 3 in chapter 3 of Carroll's book.

\question{3}{}
Prove that if the equation for a geodesic has the form
\begin{align}
    \frac{d^2 x^\alpha}{d p_i^2} + \Gamma^\alpha_{\beta \gamma} \frac{d x^\beta}{dp_i}\dfrac{d x^\gamma}{d p_i}=0,
\end{align}
for two different parameters $p_1$ and $p_2$ defined along the geodesic then the most general relation between them is $p_2= Ap_1+B$ where $A$ and $B$ are constants.
