\question{1}{}
Show explicitly that the $4$-vector current density for a collection of point charges satisfies $\partial_\mu J^\mu=0$


\clearpage
\question{2}{}
Prove that the electromagnetic energy density squared minus the square of the Poynting vector is a Lorentz invariant for an electromagnetic field by expressing this quantity in terms of tensors. You might consider using the dual field strength tensor defined by $\widetilde{F}^{\mu\nu}=\frac{1}{2}\varepsilon^{\mu\nu\alpha\beta}F_{\mu\nu}$.

\clearpage
\question{3}{}
Calculate the scalar ${T^\alpha}_\alpha$ associated with the electromagnetic stress tensor.
