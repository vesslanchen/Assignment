\question{1}{}
In lecture we studied the time dilation of a slowly moving object in a weak stationary gravitational field. We found that the frequency difference of identical clocks located at points $\mathbf{x}_1$ and $\mathbf{x}_2$ and at rest in the gravitational field is


\begin{align}
\frac{\nu_2-\nu_1}{\nu_0}=\frac{\Delta \nu}{\nu_0}=\phi_2-\phi_1,    
\end{align}
where $\phi$ is the gravitational potential. Generalize this formula to the case when they are moving with velocities $\mathbf{v}_1$ and $\mathbf{v}_2$ which are small compared to the speed of light. This results in contributions from both gravity and special relativity.

\question{2}{}
Prove that $V_{\mu ; \nu} \equiv \partial V_\mu / \partial x^\nu-\Gamma_{\mu \nu}^\lambda V_\lambda$ transforms as a second rank tensor, similar to how we proved it for $V^\mu{ }_{; \nu}$ in class, assuming that $V$ transforms as a 4 -vector.

\question{3}{}
Show that
\begin{align}
A_{\mu \nu ; \lambda}+A_{\lambda \mu ; \nu}+A_{\nu \lambda ; \mu}=A_{\mu \nu, \lambda}+A_{\lambda \mu, \nu}+A_{\nu \lambda, \mu},    
\end{align}
when $A_{\mu \nu}$ is an anti-symmetric tensor.
