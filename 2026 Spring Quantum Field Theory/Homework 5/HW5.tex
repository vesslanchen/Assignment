\question{1}{}
Consider quantal one-dimensional problem described by the Lagrangian
\begin{align}
    \mathcal{L} = \frac{1}{2} \dot{X}^2 - V(X),
\end{align}
where 
\begin{align}
    V(X) = \lambda (X^2 - \eta^2)^2,
\end{align}
where $\eta$ is real and positive. This is so-called double-well potential. Find the classical trajectory in the Euclidean time connecting the point $X = -\eta$ in the distant past with the
point $X = \eta$ in the distant future (keeping in mind that $T$ will be set to $\infty$ at the end). 

Why do we need Euclidean time? We will use this trajectory in subsequent lectures.
